continued employment through March&nbsp;10, 2017 (the &#147;Separation Date&#148;). The Separation Agreement contains a customary release of claims and provides that Mr.&nbsp;Scharf shall transition his duties to his successor and otherwise remain
available to consult on matters related to his role until the Separation Date. It also provides for (i)&nbsp;the continued payment through the Separation Date of Mr.&nbsp;Scharf&#146;s base salary, including the vesting of previously granted Company

prior to such participant&#146;s termination shall be forfeited and returned to the Company, (ii)&nbsp;all awards that vested after termination as a result of a Qualifying Retirement (as defined in the 2017 Equity Plan) shall be forfeited and
returned to the Company and (iii)&nbsp;in the event a participant sold shares from any awards described under clause (i)&nbsp;or (ii), then such participant shall make a cash payment to Baxter in an amount equal to the value recognized from the sale
or exercise of such awards within 30 business days of written notice by the Company to such participant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The description of the 2017
